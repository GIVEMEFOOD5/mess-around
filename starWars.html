        It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base,
        have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
        <br><br>
        During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon,
        the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet.
        <br><br>
        Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship,
        custodian of the stolen plan that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy...
